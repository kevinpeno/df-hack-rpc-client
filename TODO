Real shit:
  ☐ build a service proto file (example: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/protos/route_guide.proto)
  ☐ import df-hack protos into that file
    ☐ go docs pr: https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/pull/1338
    ☐ go docs: https://godoc.org/github.com/BenLubar/dfhackrpc
    ☐ magic: https://github.com/BenLubar/dfhackrpc/blob/aa308501f1a554116dbba46bbcd6bb12f869874c/protocol.go#L14
    ☐ magic: https://github.com/JapaMala/armok-vision/blob/a2e33d483d95bcf2fb145a86d93b9d5a59ff3a27/Assets/RemoteClientLocal/RemoteClient.cs#L52
    ☐ handshake solution in node? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20979800/send-byte-array-in-node-js-to-server
      ☐ probably can design them as `const clientHandshake = Buffer.from("DFHack?\n\x01\x00\x00\x00", 'utf8')`
  ☐ expose node interface using grpc? (do I need this or just clean up the exports?)
    ☐ notes: https://www.grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/node/
  ☐ profit?

Fallback:
  ☐ install https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-go-require
  ☐ somehow install and use client in https://github.com/BenLubar/dfhackrpc
